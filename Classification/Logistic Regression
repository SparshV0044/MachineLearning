A logistic regression model predicts a dependent data variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables.
For example, a logistic regression could be used to predict whether a political candidate will win or lose an election or whether a high school student will be admitted
to a particular college.





from sklearn.linear_model import Logisticregression
Classifier = LogisticRegression()
classifier.fit(xtrain,ytrain)
ypred = classifier.predict(xtest)
