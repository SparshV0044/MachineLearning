Supervised learning - Because both are labelled (input nad output) also the output depends on the input
                    Divided into two:
                      Classification(discrete)
                      Regression(Continuous)
Unspervised Learning - Only input parameters are available
                     Divided into two:
                      Clustering(Grouping and finding on the basis of multiple inputs)
                      Association(Supermarket example)
 Semi Supervised Learning - Mixed(Image data sets processing)
 Reinforcement - Bots (Perform  & gets reward)
                 Increases performance 
                 Competes with itself and human
